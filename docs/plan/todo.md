# My project checklist

- [ ] Improve accessability
  - [X] Add compatibility for different consoles (see `psutils`) within windows

  - [X] Put on PyPI
  - [X] Rename to j-chess or fix readme
- [ ] Improve dev workflow
  - [ ] Add automatic versioning using `git` describe or other
  - [ ] Should probably add some tests - though might be overkill here
  - [ ] Remove the need for constants.py
- [ ] Clean up code to reduce complexity and increase readability. In particular:
  - [X] Refactor `GameState` (see 2 TODO's in code)
  - [ ] Research implementing `curses` std-lib functions
  - [X] Update pallet code
  - [ ] I don't like how `black` formats functions with many parameters - replace?
- [ ] Add features
  - [ ] Add simple multiplayer - no idea how this would work.
  - [ ] Add a simple 1 player mode (based on random moves)

  - [ ] Add check & checkmate functionality
  - [ ] Add castling
  - [ ] Add en passant
  - [ ] Add promotion
- [ ] Improve visuals
  - [X] Add boarder
  - [ ] Add more color to score etc
  - [ ] Change "target" coordinates to show on hover
  - [ ] Unicode pieces if supported; harder than apparent - they take up > 1 space
  - [ ] Fix "abcdefg" and "01234567" labels.
  - [ ] Allow rotation of the board
