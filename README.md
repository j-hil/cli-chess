# J-Chess: Play chess in the console!

A project which enables you to play chess from within your console. Just a pet project
and lacking a lot of features (see [`TODO.md`](docs/plan/todo.md)) it is functional
if you want to play a game with a friend locally (or just play yourself?).

To play simply install from the `jchess` package from PyPI and run the package as a
module, i.e run `pip install jchess` and `python -m jchess`.

Enjoy!

Python features used: generators, context managers, dataclasses, typing, regexes, OOP
patterns.
